You should have django 1.8+

By the following commands; install all the dependencies (in linux):
	sudo pip install TwitterAPI
	sudo pip install --upgrade requests


Assumptions made:
1) I have sent the emails from my mail ID instead of Hashtag@EversnapApp.com as I didn't have its password.

2) Since refreshing of the album is done in every 20 minutes, it is possible that quite many images are added at once (say from 290 they become 300+ after refresh (but are still less than 400)). In that case, a mail will be sent with subject "#carnival has 300 photos". Hence, the last mail will have subject "#carnival has 500 photos". It will be sent when the album has 500+ photos for the first time. On increment in number of photos later, no email will be sent.

3) The REST API and facebook upload has not been done yet.
